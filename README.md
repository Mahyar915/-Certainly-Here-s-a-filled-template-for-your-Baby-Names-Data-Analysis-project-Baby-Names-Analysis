# Baby Names Data Analysis
## Project Description
This project analyzes baby names data from the US Social Security Administration, focusing on the popularity of names over recent years. The program reads data from a CSV file, processes it, and performs various analyses, such as identifying trends, the most popular names, and changes in name popularity. The results are formatted and outputted to a text file, providing insights into naming trends in the United States.
## How to Run
Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed, such as GCC.
Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
Compile the code using the command g++ -o babyNamesAnalysis main.cpp (replace main.cpp with the actual name of your source file).
Run the program with the command ./babyNamesAnalysis on Unix/Linux or babyNamesAnalysis.exe on Windows.
The program will ask for the input CSV file name; provide the path to your data file.
After processing, check the baby_name_analysis.txt file in the project directory for the output.
